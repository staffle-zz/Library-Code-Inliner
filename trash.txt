We have played around with various CNN architectures in order to find the architectures that can potentially give the highest accuracy.
We started with VGG16 architecture. It's really  But the accuracy with VGG 16 was simply not high enough.
We have come to the concluion after reseach that IV3 , Densenet , resnet are the models that can potentially give accuracy greater than the existing state of the art model.

Why Resnet50 :
	This model was the winner of ImageNet challenge in 2015. The fundamental breakthrough with ResNet was it allowed us to train extremely deep neural networks with 150+layers successfully.

Why DenseNet121 :
	DenseNets have several compelling advantages: they alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, strengthen feature propagation, encourage feature reuse, and substantially reduce the number of parameters.

Why InceptionV3 :
	Inception v3 is a widely-used image recognition model that has been shown to attain greater than 78.1% accuracy on the ImageNet dataset. The model is the culmination of many ideas developed by multiple researchers over the years.



 ROC curve is a performance measurement for the classification problems at various threshold settings. ROC is a probability curve and AUC represents the degree or measure of separability. It tells how much the model is capable of distinguishing between classes.
